Q: What'd I do to blow up the coordinates from binary kilometers to meters?
A:
$ jq '.[].points[][] |= (. * 1024 | floor)' arcs.json  > arcs2.json
$ jq '.[]["x", "y"] |= (. * 1024 | floor)' images.json > images2.json
$ jq '.[].p["x", "y"] |= (. * 1024 | floor)' labels.json > labels2.json
$ jq '.[]["x", "y"] |= (. * 1024 | floor)' roads.json > roads2.json

Q: Do I want to keep the representation of arcs including both endpoints?
A: Yeah, I think it'll be fewer headaches when I have three or more
arcs joined up at a vertex. Otherwise it'll depend on the orientation
of the arc whether it includes that vertex or not.

Q: What does this mean I have to do?
A: Track multiple vertex-ownership. If I'm dealing with the origin of
an arc that loops back on itself, that single arc owns the vertex
twice.

Q: What sanity check do I want to impose?
A: That if a single arc has multiple ownership of a vertex, it *only*
occurs between the first and last points in the arc. Something similar
for multiarc polygons.

Q: How did I slurp all the json together into one blob?
A:
$ jq -s '[["labels", "images", "arcs", "features", "roads"] as $k \
 | range(0; ($k | length)) as $ix | {key: $k[$ix], value: .[$ix]}] \
 | from_entries 'labels.json images.json arcs.json features.json roads.json
